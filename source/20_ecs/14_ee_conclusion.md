## Conclusion

A gradual transition from a traditional **object-oriented inheritance** entity encoding technique to a **data-oriented composition** one was shown in this chapter. The data-oriented composition approach allows an efficient and correct implementation of the **Entity-Component-System** pattern.

Every analyzed entity encoding technique has several advantages and drawbacks - the complexity of a project is the most important parameter to consider when choosing between them.
