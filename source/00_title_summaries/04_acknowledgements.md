# Colophon {.unnumbered}

This thesis was written using the following technologies:

* [**Pandoc**](http://pandoc.org/), an universal document converter. 

    * Most of the document was written in *"Pandoc's extended Markdown"*. Inline \LaTeX was used for pseudocode algorithm blocks *(using the **algorithm2e** package)* and for the frontispiece.

    * Code snippets are formatted and highlighted thanks to the [minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted) package and the [pandoc-minted](https://github.com/nick-ulle/pandoc-minted) Pandoc filter.

* [**pp**](https://github.com/CDSoft/pp), a "generic document preprocessor with Pandoc in mind". It allows inline inclusion of different diagram types and scripts directly in a Markdown file.

    * [**Graphviz**](http://www.graphviz.org) and [**PlantUML**](http://plantuml.com/) were invoked through *pp* to generate most of the graphs present in the thesis.

* [**dia**](http://dia-installer.de/), an open-source diagram editor.
